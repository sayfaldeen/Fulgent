# Background
This repository contains the code to calculate genomic coverage from an NGS BAM file generated from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data aligned against the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB, NA12878/HG001) reference sample. The sample was aligned to GRCh38 reference genome and the coverage was calculated across chromosomes instead of per base position / gene / CpG etc... as a basic example.
